üé¨ Usage Examples

Basic Video Generation

Python


import requests

response = requests.post('https://your-service.railway.app/generate-video', json={
    'prompt': 'A beautiful sunset over mountains',
    'duration': 6
})

data = response.json()
if data['success']:
    video_data = data['video_data']  # Base64 encoded video


Model-Specific Generation

Python


# Force photorealistic model
response = requests.post('https://your-service.railway.app/generate-video', json={
    'prompt': 'A realistic cat playing',
    'model_type': 'photorealistic',
    'duration': 6
})

# Force animation model
response = requests.post('https://your-service.railway.app/generate-video', json={
    'prompt': 'Cartoon cat dancing',
    'model_type': 'animation',
    'duration': 2
})


üîç Troubleshooting

Common Issues

Out of Memory Error:

‚Ä¢
Reduce duration

‚Ä¢
Use CPU mode

‚Ä¢
Restart service to clear memory

Model Loading Failed:

‚Ä¢
Check internet connection

‚Ä¢
Verify sufficient storage space

‚Ä¢
Check Railway logs for specific errors

Slow Generation:
