‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test.py


üöÇ Step 2: Deploy to Railway

2.1 Create Railway Project

1.
Go to Railway.app

2.
Click "New Project"

3.
Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"

4.
Choose your mythiq-video-creator repository

2.2 Configure Railway Settings

Railway will automatically:

‚Ä¢
‚úÖ Detect Python project (from requirements.txt)

‚Ä¢
‚úÖ Use configuration from railway.json

‚Ä¢
‚úÖ Start build process

2.3 Monitor Deployment

Expected timeline:

‚Ä¢
Build: 10-15 minutes (installing dependencies)

‚Ä¢
Model Download: 20-30 minutes (first startup)

‚Ä¢
Total: 30-45 minutes for first deployment

Check deployment logs for:

Plain Text


‚úÖ Installing dependencies...
‚úÖ Starting Mythiq Video Creator...
‚úÖ Device: cuda (or cpu)
‚úÖ Video models will be loaded on first request


‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure Railway Resources

3.1 Upgrade Railway Plan

üß™ Step 4: Test Your Deployment

4.1 Get Your Service URL

Railway will provide a URL like:

Plain Text


https://mythiq-video-creator-production.up.railway.app


4.2 Test Health Check

Bash


curl https://your-service-url.up.railway.app/health


Expected response:

JSON


{
  "status": "online",

  "device": "cuda",
  "cuda_available": true,
  "models_loaded": {
    "mochi": false,
    "cogvideo": false,
    "animatediff": false
  },
  "message": "Video generation service ready"
}


4.3 Run Test Script

Bash


# Update test.py with your Railway URL
python test.py https://your-service-url.up.railway.app


4.4 Test Video Generation

Bash


curl -X POST https://your-service-url.up.railway.app/generate-video \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "A cat playing with a ball", "duration": 6}'


üéØ Step 5: Frontend Integration

5.1 Add Environment Variable

In your mythiq-ui Railway service:

‚Ä¢
Variable: VITE_VIDEO_API

‚Ä¢
Value: https://mythiq-video-creator-production.up.railway.app

5.2 Update Frontend Code

Add Video Studio tab to your App.jsx:

JSX


// Add to your tab navigation
<button
  onClick={() => setActiveTab('video')}
  className={`px-6 py-3 rounded-lg font-medium transition-all ${
    activeTab === 'video'
      ? 'bg-red-600 text-white shadow-lg'
      : 'bg-gray-700 text-gray-300 hover:bg-gray-600'
  }`}
>
  üé¨ Video Studio
</button>

// Add Video Studio component
{activeTab === 'video' && (
  <div className="space-y-6">
    <div className="text-center">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">üé¨ Video Studio</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-400">Generate videos with AI</p>
    </div>
    
    <div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-6">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">üé• Video Generation</h3>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Describe the video you want to create..."
        className="w-full p-3 bg-gray-700 text-white rounded-lg resize-none"
        rows="3"
      />
      <div className="mt-3 flex gap-3">
        <select className="p-2 bg-gray-700 text-white rounded">
          <option value="auto">Auto-detect</option>
          <option value="photorealistic">Photorealistic</option>
          <option value="creative">Creative</option>
          <option value="animation">Animation</option>
        </select>
        <select className="p-2 bg-gray-700 text-white rounded">
          <option value="6">6 seconds</option>
          <option value="4">4 seconds</option>
          <option value="2">2 seconds</option>
        </select>
        <button className="px-6 py-2 bg-red-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-red-700">
          Generate Video
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>

üîç Step 6: Troubleshooting

Common Issues & Solutions

‚ùå Build Failed

Symptoms: Railway build fails during dependency installation
Solutions:

‚Ä¢
Check requirements.txt for typos

‚Ä¢
Verify Python version compatibility

‚Ä¢
Check Railway build logs for specific errors

‚ùå Health Check Timeout

Symptoms: Service shows "Unhealthy" status
Solutions:

‚Ä¢
Increase healthcheck timeout in railway.json

‚Ä¢
Check if service is binding to 0.0.0.0:PORT

‚Ä¢
Monitor memory usage (may need more RAM)

‚ùå Model Loading Failed

Symptoms: Video generation returns errors
Solutions:

‚Ä¢
Check internet connectivity for model downloads

‚Ä¢
Verify sufficient storage space (25GB+)

‚Ä¢
Monitor Railway logs during first model load

‚ùå Out of Memory

Symptoms: Service crashes during video generation
Solutions:

‚Ä¢
Upgrade Railway plan to higher memory

‚Ä¢
Reduce video duration

‚Ä¢
Enable CPU offloading (already configured)

‚ùå Slow Generation

Symptoms: Video generation takes very long
Solutions:

‚Ä¢
Upgrade to GPU-enabled Railway plan

‚Ä¢
Reduce inference steps in code

‚Ä¢
Use shorter video durations

Performance Optimization

Memory Usage

Python


# Already implemented in app.py
- CPU offloading for models
- VAE slicing for memory efficiency
- Automatic memory cleanup
- Garbage collection after generation


Speed Optimization

Python


# Model-specific optimizations
- Mochi-1: 64 steps (highest quality)
- CogVideoX: 50 steps (balanced)
- AnimateDiff: 25 steps (fastest)


üìä Step 7: Monitor Performance

Railway Metrics

Monitor in Railway dashboard:

‚Ä¢
CPU Usage: Should spike during generation

‚Ä¢
Memory Usage: 8-16GB during active generation

‚Ä¢
Network: High during model downloads

‚Ä¢
Storage: 25GB+ for all models

Service Metrics

Check via /health endpoint:

‚Ä¢
Models Loaded: Track which models are ready

‚Ä¢
Device: Verify GPU availability

‚Ä¢
Response Times: Monitor generation speed

Cost Monitoring

Expected Railway costs:

‚Ä¢
Base Service: $20/month (Pro plan)

‚Ä¢
Memory (16GB): $30-50/month

‚Ä¢
CPU (High-performance): $20-40/month

‚Ä¢
Storage (32GB): $10-15/month

‚Ä¢
Total: $80-125/month
